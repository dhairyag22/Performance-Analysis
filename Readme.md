### Performance Analysis

The project focuses on performance analysis of an oil field, where I studied production, injection, and pressure data from 20+ wells spanning multiple
decades. The objective was to evaluate reservoir performance, identify key production trends, and assess the effectiveness of water injection schemes to support recovery.

### Methodology

* **Data Collection & Organization:** Compiled and arranged historical production, injection, and pressure data well-wise and for specific sand.

* **Visualization:** Plotted data using Microsoft Excel (oil & liquid production, cumulative production, GOR, water cut, injection rates, cumulative injection  reservoir pressure).

* **Trend Analysis:** Interpreted production decline, water breakthrough, gas-oil ratio variations, and reservoir pressure responses.

* **Sand Analysis:** Conducted analysis of reservoir sand behaviour including pressure depletion and injection effects.

### Key Insights

* Wells showed distinct phases of production, shut-in periods, and conversion to injectors.

* Water cut trends indicated breakthrough in several wells with late-life high-water production.

* Injection wells significantly influenced reservoir pressure maintenance.

* Sand analysis revealed initial depletion drive followed by pressure support from injection.

### Deliverables

* *PDF Report* with detailed well-by-well interpretations, graphs, and final sand analysis.

* *Visualizations* include production vs time, cumulative production, GOR, water cut, pressure response and injection plots.
